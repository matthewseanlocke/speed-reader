# AGENTS.md

This repository is a single-file, static HTML app (`speed-reader.html`).
There is no build system, package manager, or automated tests.

If you add new tooling in the future, update this file.

## Repository Overview
- Entry point: `speed-reader.html`
- Assets: PNG images used for reference only
- No bundler, no dependencies, no module system

## Build / Lint / Test
There are currently no automated build, lint, or test commands.

Manual run (recommended):
- Open `speed-reader.html` directly in a browser

Manual smoke checks:
- Start reading and confirm word display updates
- Click-to-begin overlay appears and starts on click
- Pause/resume on click and spacebar
- Change settings and verify preview updates
- Verify saved settings reload on refresh

Single test:
- Not available (no test runner)

If tooling is added later, add explicit commands here, including:
- Full test suite
- Single test invocation
- Lint/format commands

## Code Style Guidelines

### Structure
- Keep all HTML, CSS, and JS inside `speed-reader.html`
- Maintain current order: HTML, `<style>`, then `<script>`
- Avoid splitting into multiple files unless requested

### Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in HTML/CSS/JS
- Keep lines reasonably short for readability
- Use consistent brace style (existing style uses same-line braces)

### Imports / Dependencies
- No external libraries or CDN dependencies
- Keep it self-contained and offline-friendly

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, camelCase names for JS functions and variables
- Use kebab-case for CSS class names
- Prefer `const` for DOM references, `let` only when reassigned

### CSS
- Prefer class-based styling over inline styles
- Inline styles are acceptable only for dynamic runtime values
  (e.g., color, font-size, preview text)
- Avoid hardcoded colors in CSS that conflict with settings
- Keep a dark, minimal aesthetic consistent with the reading overlay
- Use subtle transitions; avoid heavy animations

### JavaScript
- Keep logic in small, focused functions
- Avoid alert() popups; use UI hints instead (e.g., highlight input)
- Use `localStorage` for user preferences and text persistence
- Update preview and reading display immediately on setting changes
- Avoid global variables unless necessary (current file uses top-level)

### Error Handling
- Prefer graceful UI feedback over exceptions or alerts
- Validate user input and clamp numeric values where needed
- No throwing errors for normal user flows

### Text/Content
- Default text is a public-domain poem (“The Road Not Taken”)
- Keep default text ASCII-only
- Avoid copyrighted text unless explicitly requested

### Accessibility / UX
- Click-to-begin overlay should be clickable anywhere
- Clicking anywhere on reading screen should pause/resume
- Keep keyboard shortcuts working (Space, Escape)
- Ensure controls are hidden by default during reading

### Versioning
- Version number is shown in the `h1` title
- Bump version whenever user-facing behavior or UI changes

## UI/UX Constraints
- Maintain a dark, minimal settings screen
- Preview should reflect all current settings
- ORP (red letter) must remain anchored on screen
- Avoid distracting UI elements during reading mode

## Files / Paths
- Main file: `speed-reader.html`
- Do not remove reference images unless asked

## Cursor / Copilot Rules
- No Cursor rules found (`.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules`)
- No Copilot instructions found (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)

## When You Change Behavior
- Update preview logic and runtime display together
- Ensure new settings persist via `localStorage`
- Re-check read/pause/resume flows for regressions

## Suggested Manual Verification Checklist
- Start reading with click-to-begin overlay
- Pause/resume by clicking anywhere on overlay (except controls)
- Pause/resume via Space
- Exit via Escape and Exit button
- Adjust font size and colors; verify ORP anchor stability
- Confirm saved settings are restored on refresh

## Notes for Agentic Tools
- Use `Read` for file inspection and `apply_patch` for edits
- Avoid altering PNG files unless explicitly requested
- Keep ASCII characters unless the file already uses non-ASCII
